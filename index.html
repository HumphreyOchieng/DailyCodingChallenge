            <p class="faq__question">Can I benefit Daily Coding Challenges?</p>
            <p class="faq__answer">
                This service is primarily intended for people who are preparing for coding interviews and need to prepare for the 
                questions asked by the interviewers. However, it's also useful for people who wish to test themselves
                periodically to retain their knowledge of programming concepts.

            <p class="faq__question">How does Daily Coding Challenge differ from similar offerings?</p>
            <p class="faq__answer">
                We offer a curated newsletter for both free and paying subscribers because we believe that there is more to coding interviews
                than simply practicing problems. There are 3 handpicked articles per newsletter that are meant to broaden your knowledge and understanding of programming concepts as well as best practices in the professional industry.

            <p class="faq__question">What are Topic Requests?</p>
            <p class="faq__answer">
                This is a feature available in the paid plans but not in the free tier. By sending an email to our email address with the name of a topic,
                you'll recieve only questions from that topic for the next week. At the moment there are 5 topics with more to come. This feature is useful when you are studying a specific topic or if you are already familiar with most of the topics. The topic request lasts for a week after which you can make a new request or continue
                recieving challenges from random topics.

            <p class="faq__answer">
                The weekly newsletter is available for all plans and includes 3 articles that are hand picked from different sites.
                They are meant to improve your coding knowledge and contain information related to programming concepts, code interviews, best practices
                and other related topics.
